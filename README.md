# Simulation-of-a-2R-Elbow-Manipulator
This is the Python Simulation of a 2R Manipulator for permorming various tasks. Following are the tasks:
1) Python simulation with visualization that implements a trajectory
following controller that makes the robot follow an arbitrary end-tip
trajectory. (With and Without Dynamics)
2) Developing a Python simulation and visualization of the task of the robot reaching the wall
and then applying a prespecified force in the normal direction of the wall.
3) Plotting the workspace of the robot if if both joint angles can only sweep between 35 degrees and 145 degree.
